      <p>Hello! I'm a full-time student at BMCC and my major is now Multimedia Programming. I was a Computer Science Major, <br>
          but turns out I DON'T like math. I want to become a Web Developer and hope this class helps me learn how to code better<br>
          and more efficiently. </p>
